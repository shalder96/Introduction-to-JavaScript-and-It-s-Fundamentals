    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>HTML</th>
            <th>JavaScript</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is primarily used for creating the structure and content of web pages. It defines the layout, text, images, links, and other elements that make up a webpage's visual appearance and structure.</td>
            <td>JavaScript, on the other hand, is a scripting language used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It enables developers to create responsive and interactive elements such as animations, form validation, games, and dynamic content updates without requiring a page reload.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HTML is a markup language, meaning it uses tags to define the structure and content of web pages. Tags are used to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and other elements.</td>
            <td>JavaScript is a programming language that allows developers to write scripts that are executed by the browser to manipulate the HTML structure, interact with users, and control the behavior of web pages.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HTML is parsed and executed by the browser to render the structure and content of web pages. It is a static language, meaning that once the page is loaded, its content remains unchanged unless the page is refreshed.</td>
            <td>JavaScript code, on the other hand, is executed by the browser's JavaScript engine. It can dynamically modify the HTML structure, respond to user interactions, make requests to servers, and update the content of web pages without requiring a page reload.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HTML uses a markup syntax with tags enclosed in angle brackets (&lt;tag&gt;). Tags are often used in pairs (e.g., &lt;p&gt; for paragraph opening tag and &lt;/p&gt; for paragraph closing tag) to define elements and their attributes.</td>
            <td>JavaScript uses a programming syntax with statements, expressions, variables, functions, and objects. It has a C-like syntax and supports features such as loops, conditionals, and error handling.</td>
        </tr>

    <h3>Integration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML is integrated directly into web pages and is often embedded within <b>&lt;html&gt;</b> , <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> , and <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> tags.</li>
        <li>JavaScript can be included in HTML pages using <b>&lt;script&gt;</b>  tags. It can also be included externally in separate <b>`.js`</b> files and linked to HTML pages using the <b>`src`</b> attribute of the <b>&lt; script &gt;</b>  tag.</li>
    </ul>

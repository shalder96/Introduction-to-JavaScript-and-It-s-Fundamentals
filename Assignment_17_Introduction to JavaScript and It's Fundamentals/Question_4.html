    <h3>Purpose of declaring variables:</h3>
    <p>The purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript is to reserve memory space to store data values that can be manipulated or accessed later in the program. Variables serve as placeholders for storing various types of data such as numbers, strings, boolean values, objects, and more.</p>
    <h3>Declaration process:</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the let keyword. The let keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and is used to declare block-scoped variables. Here's how you declare variables using the let keyword:</p>
    <p>let variableName;
        In this syntax:
        <ul>
            <li><b>`let`</b> is the keyword used to declare variables.</li>
            <li><b>`variableName`</b>is the name you choose for the variable. It should follow the rules for variable naming in JavaScript, which include starting with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($) followed by letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>You can also initialize the variable with a value at the time of declaration:</p>
        <p>let variableName = value;
        </p>
        <p>In this case:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>value</b> is the initial value assigned to the variable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are a few examples of variable declarations using the <b>`let`</b> keyword:</p>
        <p>
            <b>let</b> age;
            <b>let</b> firstName = "John";
            <b>let</b> isStudent = true;
            <b>let</b> pi = 3.14;

        </p>
    </p>

    <h3>Importance of comments in JavaScript</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Explanation:</b>Comments provide additional context or explanations about the code, making it easier for other developers (or even your future self) to understand the purpose and functionality of different parts of the code.</li>
        <li><b>Documentation:</b>Comments can serve as documentation for functions, variables, classes, or complex algorithms, helping other developers understand how to use or modify them.</li>
        <li><b>Debugging</b>Comments can be used to temporarily disable or "comment out" a block of code for debugging purposes without removing it entirely. This allows developers to test different parts of the code without affecting the rest of the program.</li>
        <li><b>TO DOs and Notes:</b>Comments can also be used to mark sections of code that need further work or improvement (TODOs), as well as to leave notes for yourself or other developers about potential optimizations, alternative approaches, or known issues.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Here are examples of single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript:</h3>
    <h4>Single-line comment:</h4>
    <p>// This is a single-line comment
        let message = "Hello, World!";
        </p>
    <h4>Multi-line comment:</h4>
    <p>/*
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It can span multiple lines and is useful for
        longer comments or block comments.
     */
     let age = 25;
     </p>
